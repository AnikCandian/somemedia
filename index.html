					<p class="postcontent">Roofing is okay, I guess. It's repetitious and it demands a good build, but it does pay the bills. Also, you don't need to go through university (or rather, afford going there) to become one. Man, do I wish I was richer. I would've loved to go to university...</p>

					<postname>A Short Memorial of My Parents</postname>
					<p class="postcontent">On this very day a few years ago, my mom and dad passed away from an auto wreck. It just happened abruptly. I can remember the moments where I shot ducks with my old man and conversed with my mother. And so much more. Yet, they're gone, never to be seen again. I hope they're doing well wherever they are now.</p>

					<p class="postcontent">Ponyboy has an arrest warrant after killing a Soc. Now, he's running away from the fuzz in Texas. Hopefully, he's doing alright down there.</p>

					<status>Darry Curtis is <strong>complaining about backpains</strong></status>
					<p class="postcontent">Rooflifting is not an easy job. Doing it proficiently is hard on your back. Add to that that Sodapop's mediocre back massages don't do anything, and it's infuriating.</p>

						<p class="postcontent"><strong>Sodapop Curtis</strong> Hey I try >:(</p>
						<p class="postcontent"><strong>Ponyboy Curtis</strong> It's not anyone's fault you pick up two bundles or so of roofing whenever you do your job to get such a crooked back. That's on you.</p>
						<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><strong>Darry Curtis</strong> <i>(in reply to Ponyboy Curtis)</i> I only do it for the bonuses.</p>
